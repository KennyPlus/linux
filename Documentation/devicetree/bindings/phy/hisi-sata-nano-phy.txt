Hisilicon SATA NANO PHY
-----------------------

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "hisilicon,hisi-sata-nano-phy"
- reg: offset and length of the PHY registers
- #phy-cells: must be 0
Refer to phy/phy-bindings.txt for the generic PHY binding properties

Optional Properties:
- hisilicon,peripheral-syscon: phandle of syscon used to control peripheral.
- hisilicon,power-reg: offset and bit number within peripheral-syscon,
	register of controlling sata power supply.

Example:
	sata_phy: phy@f9900000 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hisi-sata-nano-phy";
		reg = <0xf9900000 0x10000>;
		#phy-cells = <0>;
		hisilicon,peripheral-syscon = <&peripheral_ctrl>;
		hisilicon,power-reg = <0x8 10>;
	};
