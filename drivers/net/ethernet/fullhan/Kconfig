	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Faraday cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

	  This is the driver for the Ethernet IPs are built around a
	  Synopsys IP Core.

	default n
	help
	  Selecting this option, rx has priority over Tx (only for Giga
	  Ethernet device).
	  By default, the DMA arbitration scheme is based on Round-robin
	  (rx:tx priority is 1:1).

	bool "FH Independent Research Ephy"
	default n
	help
	  This is the driver for Independent Research Ephy.
